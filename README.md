# Whirlpool VR Experience
This is a Unreal project created by Lead Witch Studios on behalf of Digital Image.

# Description
This application is made to address a need by the customer to replace having multiple physical stoves at trade shows. Using the Metaquest 3, users will
be able to be guided through an informational game to show the potential of the wipe-clean surface for cooktops, and information on the AirFry technology.
